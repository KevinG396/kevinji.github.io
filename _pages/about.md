I'm a second year master student in [Stream Based Supercomputing Lab](https://sbs.wustl.edu), advised by Prof. [Roger Chamberlain](https://www.ccrc.wustl.edu/~roger/). My research interests lie in `machine learning` (particularly Bayesian inversion problems) and `computer systems` (particularly general-purpose processor performance optimization), as well as the intersection of these two areas.
