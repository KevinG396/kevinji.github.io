I'm Binglin (Kevin) Ji, a second-year master's student in `Electrical Engineering` and `Computer Engineering` at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://washu.edu). I'm a member of [Stream Based Supercomputing Lab](https://sbs.wustl.edu), advised by Prof. [Roger Chamberlain](https://www.ccrc.wustl.edu/~roger/). My research interests lie in **Machine Learning** (Bayesian Inversion problems) and **Parallel Computing** (AI Inference Acceleration), as well as the intersection of these two areas. 

Before coming to WashU, I worked at [Lenovo Research](https://research.lenovo.com/webapp/view_English/home.html), Shanghai, China, where I developed deep learning algorithms to solve computer vision problems in industrial scenarios and built container-based systems to optimize machine learning workflows.



## Fast GNN Inference on Multi-Core Systems <br> [IPDPS Workshops](https://www.ipdps.org/ipdps2025/2025-workshops.html)

Existing standard Graph Neural Network (GNN) libraries face challenges in performance and scalability on modern multi-core systems, especially for large graphs (more than 100,000 vertices) with heavy embeddings. We optimized GNN inference with different parallel strategies according to the properties of input graphs, considering the design trends of multi-core architectures. As a result, we achieved up to **2.64x** inference speed compared to `DGL v2.4.0` (Deep Graph Library) and **3.36x** compared to `PyG v2.6.1` (PyTorch-Geometric), both of which used `PyTorch v2.3.1` as the backend.
