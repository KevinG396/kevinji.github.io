I am a second-year master's student in `Electrical Engineering` and `Computer Engineering` at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://washu.edu). I'm a member of [Stream Based Supercomputing Lab](https://sbs.wustl.edu), advised by Prof. [Roger Chamberlain](https://www.ccrc.wustl.edu/~roger/). My research interests lie in `machine learning` (particularly Bayesian inversion problems) and `computer systems` (particularly general-purpose processor performance optimization), as well as the intersection of these two areas. 

Before joining WashU, I worked as a research intern in [Lenovo Research](https://research.lenovo.com/webapp/view_English/researchField.html), Shanghai, China, where I developed deep learning algorithms to solve industrial problems and built systems to optimize machine learning workflows.

Fast GNN Inference on Multi-Core Systems
======
Existing standard Graph Neural Network (GNN) libraries face challenges in performance and scalability on multi-core CPUs, especially for large graphs (more than 100,000 vertices) with heavy embeddings. We optimized GNN inference with different parallel strategies according to the properties of input graphs. We achieved up to 2.64x inference speed compared to DGL(Deep Graph Library) and 3.36x compared to PyG(PyTorch-Geometric)
