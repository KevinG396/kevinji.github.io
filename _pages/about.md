I'm Binglin (Kevin) Ji, a second-year master's student in `Electrical Engineering` and `Computer Engineering` at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://washu.edu). I'm a member of [Stream Based Supercomputing Lab](https://sbs.wustl.edu), advised by Prof. [Roger Chamberlain](https://www.ccrc.wustl.edu/~roger/). My research interests lie in `machine learning` (particularly Bayesian Inversion problems) and `computer systems` (particularly Parallel Computing), as well as the intersection of these two areas. 

Before joining WashU, I worked as a research intern in [Lenovo Research](https://research.lenovo.com/webapp/view_English/researchField.html), Shanghai, China, where I developed deep learning algorithms to solve computer vision problems in industrial scenarios and built container-based systems to optimize machine learning workflows.



## Fast GNN Inference on Multi-Core Systems

Existing standard Graph Neural Network (GNN) libraries face challenges in performance and scalability on modern multi-core architectures, especially for large graphs (more than 100,000 vertices) with heavy embeddings. We optimized GNN inference with different parallel strategies according to the properties of input graphs, considering the design trends of multi-core system architectures. As a result, we achieved up to 2.64x inference speed compared to DGL (Deep Graph Library) and 3.36x compared to PyG (PyTorch-Geometric).
